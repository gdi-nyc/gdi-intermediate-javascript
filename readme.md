## Course description
This is a 4-part, 8-hour course.

Want to skill up in JavaScript? Are you ready to take your basic understanding of JavaSript to the next level? Interested in creating practical web applications? If you answered yes to any of the questions above, this course is for you!

This intermediate course will dive deepers into the more advanced topics in JavaScript for web development. By the end of the class, you will have a working Quiz application that pulls asynchronous data from an API, modifies the DOM using "vanilla" JavaScript, and responds to user input through event handlers.

Intro to JavaScript, or a basic understanding of JavaScript programming and syntax.

### Tech requirements:
 - Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay).
 - A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox with Firebug installed.
 - A text editor. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (free)
